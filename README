This software requires at least OpenGL 3.0 and an nVidia graphics card with compute capability 1.0.  Any GeForce made in the last 5-6 years should work.

Just create a build environment with CMake and compile!

SpecVis requires the following libraries:

GLEW (OpenGL Extension Wrangler) http://glew.sourceforge.net/
Qt http://qt-project.org/
RTS (my personal codebase) https://github.com/dmayerich/RTS
CUDA http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html

If CMake is unable to find these, make sure to specify their locations.

Known Bugs:
  [ ] Will not identify a data file in a project that doesn't exist.
